# News_App

Using News Api I have created a News Application. Users will be able to read the latest news. News will get refreshed from time to time. You can archive/save a news to read later too.I have used MVVM Architecture and also added SDK which I have created. 

 You will be able to read news as per your preference. There are different sections for news. E.g sports, tech, business etc
 
 There are different reliable sources that you can follow,  e.g Times of India, The Hindu, The wall street journal and many more
 
 The application is on progress. There will attach lots of upcoming features .

# Description

I have created a news application using news API.

In this app I have called API using retrofit asynchronously and I have written API call functions in SDK.

I've used mvvm architecture.

I have used live data which is extended from observable class  . If the data set is changed then it's reflect in view.
