# News_App

Using News Api I have created a News Application. Users will be able to read the latest news. News will get refreshed from time to time. You can archive/save a news to read later too.I have used MVVM Architecture and also added SDK which I have created. 

 You will be able to read news as per your preference. There are different sections for news. E.g sports, tech, business etc
